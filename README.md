🩺 Skin Disease Detector
An AI-powered web application to predict skin diseases using image inputs and text-based symptoms. Developed using Streamlit, TensorFlow/Keras, and machine learning models.

📜 Overview
This application enables users to analyze and predict skin diseases through two input methods:

Image-Based Input: Upload an image of the affected skin, and the model will predict the disease class and infection percentage using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Text-Based Input: Input your symptoms in text form, and the model will analyze the symptoms using a text classification model and provide the predicted disease.
The app is powered by deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) models for accurate disease predictions.

🚀 Features
Image Input: Classify diseases like Melanoma, Psoriasis, and Eczema.
Symptom Text Input: Analyze user-entered symptoms for disease prediction.
Responsive Design: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
Future-Ready: Placeholder for audio-based symptom analysis (coming soon).
